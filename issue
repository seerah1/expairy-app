I have a React Native + Expo project called expiry-tracker-mobile. I initially built it for web using Expo, but when I try to run it in Expo Go or as an Android APK, the app immediately crashes on launch.

Here are the details of my project issues:

Running expo doctor gives 5 failed checks out of 17:

.expo folder is not gitignored.

Package @types/react-native is installed but should not be (types are included in react-native).

Missing peer dependency: expo-font required by @expo/vector-icons.

App config fields (orientation, icon, splash, plugins, etc.) may not be synced properly.

Version mismatches:

jest: expected ~29.7.0, found 30.2.0

@react-native-community/datetimepicker: expected 8.4.4, found 8.6.0

react: expected 19.1.0, found 19.2.3

react-dom: expected 19.1.0, found 19.2.3

react-native-screens: expected ~4.16.0, found 4.20.0

@types/react: expected ~19.1.10, found 19.2.9

I built the APK using Expo, it generated successfully, but the app crashes immediately on launch.

I originally built the project for web and never ran it properly in Expo Go, so I suspect missing native dependencies.

I need a step-by-step solution that will:

Fix missing peer dependencies and unnecessary packages.

Resolve version mismatches for Expo SDK 54.

Make the app run properly in Expo Go and as a standalone APK without crashing.

Include the exact npm / npx commands to run, if possible.

Please provide a full working fix, including any package removals, installs, and adjustments to package.json.
